little「量がほとんどない」/ few「数がほとんどない」
「little」は「量がほとんどない」、「few」は「数がほとんどない」ということを表す形容詞です。
形容詞ですので名詞を修飾するのですが、その名詞が「可算名詞」の場合は「few」を、「不可算名詞」の場合は「little」を使います。
「a little」「a few」のように「a」をつけることによって否定の意味が消えて「少しはある」という意味になります。

You use 'few' and 'little' to emphasize that only a small quantity of something or a small number of people or things are involved. They can be used with 'very' for greater emphasis.
