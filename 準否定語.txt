hardly |ˈhɑːdli|
adverb
1 scarcely (used to qualify a statement by saying that it is true to an insignificant degree): the little house in which he lived was hardly bigger than a hut | a thing hardly bigger than a credit card | we hardly know each other.
• only a very short time before: the party had hardly started when the police arrived.
• only with great difficulty: she could hardly sit up | I nodded, hardly able to breath.
• no or not (suggesting surprise at or disagreement with a statement): I hardly think so.
2 archaic harshly: the rule worked hardly.

usage: Words like hardly, scarcely, and rarely should not be used with negative constructions. Thus, it is correct to say I can hardly wait but incorrect to say I can't hardly wait. This is because adverbs like hardly are treated as if they were negatives, and it is a well-known grammatical rule of standard English that double negatives (i.e. in this case having hardly and not in the same clause) are not acceptable. Words like hardly behave as negatives in other respects as well, as for example in combining with words like any or at all, which normally only occur where a negative is present (thus, standard usage is I've got hardly any money but not I've got any money). See also usage at double negative.

scarcely |ˈskɛːsli|
adverb
only just; almost not: her voice is so low I can scarcely hear what she is saying.
• only a very short time before: she had scarcely dismounted before the door swung open.

2 archaic remarkably well: you can write rarely now, after all your schooling.
• to an unusual degree; exceptionally: [ as submodifier ] : the rarely fine Sheraton bookcase.

seldom |ˈsɛldəm|
adverb
not often; rarely: Islay is seldom visited by tourists | he was seldom absent | [ in combination ] : an old seldom-used church.
adjective [ attrib. ] dated
not common; infrequent: a great but seldom pleasure.

ORIGIN
Old English fēawe, fēawa, of Germanic origin; related to Old High German fao, from an Indo-European root shared by Latin paucus and Greek pauros ‘small’.
usage: Fewer versus less: strictly speaking, the rule is that fewer, the comparative form of few, is used with words denoting people or countable things ( fewer members; fewer books). Less, on the other hand, is used with mass nouns, denoting things which cannot be counted ( less money; less bother). It is regarded as incorrect in standard English to use less with count nouns, as in less people or less words, although this is one of the most widespread errors made by native speakers. It is not so obvious which word should be used with than. Less is normally used with numerals ( a score of less than 100) and with expressions of measurement or time ( less than two weeks; less than four miles away), but fewer is used if the things denoted by the number are seen as individual items or units ( there were fewer than ten contestants).
